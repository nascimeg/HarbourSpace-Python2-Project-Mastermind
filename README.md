# HarbourSpace-Python2-Project-Mastermind
BETA Project for Python2 class at Harbour.Space - Ogabek's class

Hi Ogabek and Vlad, I'm working with Abvi, this is just so I submit a link and play around. Feel free to comment :) 


Mastermind – Python Edition
A virtual recreation of the classic Mastermind board game, where the player attempts to guess a secret color code generated by the computer.

About the Game
Mastermind is a code-breaking game for one player. Your Python script will randomly generate a secret password made of colors.
The player has a limited number of rounds to guess the password.
After each attempt, the game provides feedback to help the user find the correct sequence.
This project implements the core mechanics of the original board game:
A secret password is created by the program at the start
The password does not change throughout the game
The player submits guesses each round
The program returns feedback (e.g., correct color & position, correct color but wrong position)
The game ends when the user guesses the password or when they run out of rounds

Available Colors
You can freely configure your set of colors, but common choices include:
["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple"]
The secret password is generated randomly from this list.

Features to Implement
This project will guide you through building a full playable game in the terminal:

Random Password Generation
Generate a sequence of colors
Password length should be configurable (e.g., 4 colors)
Colors may repeat depending on your game rules

Player Guess Input
Prompt for guesses in each round
Validate input (ensure colors exist in the palette)

Feedback System
After each guess, return hints:
Black peg (●) – Correct color, correct position
White peg (○) – Correct color, wrong position
(You can represent them however you want in Python.)

Win / Lose Conditions
Game ends when:
Player matches the secret password → Win
Player reaches max rounds without guessing → Lose

Optional Improvements
Feel free to extend the game beyond the basic version:
Difficulty levels
Color repetition on/off
Save and load game state
UI with tkinter or web interface with Flask
Score history



EXAMPLE ROUND 
Available colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple  
Password length: 4  
Max rounds: 10  

Round 1 — Enter your guess (ex: red blue green yellow):  
> red green blue yellow  

Feedback: ● ○ ○
